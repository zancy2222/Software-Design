                <h3>Design Principles and Patterns</h3>
                <p>Good design principles, like the SOLID principles, help create flexible and maintainable software architectures. Key principles include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
                    <li>Open-Closed Principle (OCP)</li>
                    <li>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</li>
                    <li>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</li>
                    <li>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common design problems, categorized into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.</p>
